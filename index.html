  <section class="me">
    <p class="head1">Who am I ?</p>
    <p>I’m Zanele(19), a girl who’s still figuring life out but choosing to grow through every season. I’m curious, intentional, 
      and a little stubborn in the best way. I love tech, meaningful conversations, quiet mornings, and doing things that push 
      me out of my comfort zone<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> I’m not perfect, but I’m real, and that’s my superpower.</p>

    <p class="head2">My Extra-Curriculars</p>
<p>Outside of school, I’m a little bit of everything — and I love it that way. I’m a Miss Teenager South Africa FINALIST, 
  creating Empowerment Friday content and sharpening my voice as a youth advocate. I also read a lot, because books are 
  my escape. I draw when I want to get out of my head and express myself creatively. And when it comes to sports… I swear 
  I’m sporty in my heart, even though I’ve never actually joined a team — but the enthusiasm is there. I’m exploring, 
  creating, learning, and doing things that make life feel full and exciting.</p>

  <section class="impact">
    <p class="head3">Impactful Things I’ve Done</p>
<p>I’ve spoken openly about identity struggles, academic pressure, and the challenges young people face. I advocate for 
  the Unseen Generation, a movement that stands for the youth that feels unseen, unheard, unsupported and overlooked and I use 
  my platform to make others feel seen and understood. I’ve volunteered at the Boksburg SPCA, and at Leratong children home, I 
  became a guest speaker at QwaQwa radio, I have done multiple school visits around the Free State province, created empowering 
  content that inspires others, and committed myself to becoming a positive influence — not just online, but in real life too. 
  I also created a website for the unseen generation.</p>
